\title{function to expand an existing q_matrix to a number of
concealed states}
\usage{
expand_q_matrix(q_matrix, num_concealed_states, diff.conceal = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{q_matrix}{q_matrix with only transitions between observed states}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of concealed states}

\item{diff.conceal}{should we use the same number of rates for the
concealed state transitions, or should all concealed state transitions
have separate rates? Typically, FALSE is fine and should be used in order
to avoid having a huge number of parameters.}
}
\value{
updated q matrix
}
