\title{helper function to neatly setup a Q matrix, without transitions to
concealed states (only observed transitions shown)}
\usage{
create_transition_matrix(
  state_names,
  num_concealed_states,
  transition_list,
  diff.conceal = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state_names}{names of observed states}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of concealed states}

\item{transition_list}{matrix of transitions, indicating in order: 1)
starting state (typically the column in the transition matrix), 2) ending
state (typically the row in the transition matrix) and 3) associated rate
indicator}

\item{diff.conceal}{should we use the same number of rates for the
concealed state transitions, or should all concealed state transitions
have separate rates? Typically, FALSE is fine and should be used in order
to avoid having a huge number of parameters.}
