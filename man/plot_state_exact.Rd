\description{
this function will evaluate the log likelihood locally along
all branches and plot the result. When steps is left to NULL, all likelihood
evaluations during integration are used for plotting. This may work for not
too large trees, but may become very memory heavy for larger trees. Instead,
the user can indicate a number of steps, which causes the probabilities to be
evaluated at a distinct amount of steps along each branch (and the
probabilities to be properly integrated in between these steps). This
provides an approximation, but generally results look very similar to using
the full evaluation.
The function used for prob_func will be highly dependent on your system.
for instance, for a 3 observed, 2 hidden states model, the probability
of state A is prob[1] + prob[2] + prob[3], normalized by the row sum.
prob_func will be applied to each row of the 'states' matrix (you can thus
test your function on the states matrix returned when
'see_ancestral_states = TRUE'). Please note that the first N columns of the
states matrix are the extinction rates, and the (N+1):2N columns belong to
the speciation rates, where N = num_obs_states * num_concealed_states.
 A typical probfunc function will look like:
my_prob_func <- function(x) {
 return(sum(x[5:8]) / sum(x))
}
}
\examples{
set.seed(5)
focal_tree <- ape::rphylo(n = 4, birth = 1, death = 0)
traits <- c(0, 1, 1, 0)
params <- secsse::id_paramPos(c(0, 1), 2)
params[[1]][] <- c(0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1)
params[[2]][] <- 0.0
params[[3]][, ] <- 0.1
diag(params[[3]]) <- NA
#  Thus, we have for both, rates
# 0A, 1A, 0B and 1B. If we are interested in the posterior probability of
# trait 0,we have to provide a helper function that sums the probabilities of
# 0A and 0B, e.g.:
helper_function <- function(x) {
  return(sum(x[c(5, 7)]) / sum(x)) # normalized by total sum, just in case.
