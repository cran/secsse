\arguments{
\item{parameter}{list where first vector represents lambdas, the second mus
and the third transition rates.}

\item{phy}{phylogenetic tree of class phylo, ultrametric, fully-resolved,
rooted and with branch lengths.}

\item{traits}{vector with trait states, order of states must be the same as
tree tips, for help, see vignette.}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of concealed states, generally equivalent
to number of examined states.}

\item{cond}{condition on the existence of a node root: "maddison_cond",
"proper_cond"(default). For details, see vignette.}

\item{root_state_weight}{the method to weigh the states:
"maddison_weights","proper_weights"(default) or "equal_weights".
It can also be specified the root state:the vector c(1, 0, 0)
indicates state 1 was the root state.}

\item{sampling_fraction}{vector that states the sampling proportion per
trait state. It must have as many elements as trait states.}

\item{setting_calculation}{argument used internally to speed up calculation.
It should be left blank (default : setting_calculation = NULL)}

\item{see_ancestral_states}{should the ancestral states be shown? Default
FALSE}

\item{loglik_penalty}{the size of the penalty for all parameters; default is
0 (no penalty)}

\item{is_complete_tree}{whether or not a tree with all its extinct species
is provided}

\item{num_threads}{number of threads. Set to -1 to use all available threads.
Default is one thread.}

\item{atol}{absolute tolerance of integration}

\item{rtol}{relative tolerance of integration}

\item{method}{integration method used, available are:
"odeint::runge_kutta_cash_karp54", "odeint::runge_kutta_fehlberg78",
"odeint::runge_kutta_dopri5", "odeint::bulirsch_stoer" and
"odeint::runge_kutta4". Default method is:"odeint::bulirsch_stoer".}
}
\value{
The loglikelihood of the data given the parameter.
}
\description{
Logikelihood calculation for the SecSSE model given a set of parameters and
data
}
\note{
Multithreading might lead to a slightly reduced accuracy
(in the order of 1e-10) and is therefore not enabled by default.
Please use at your own discretion.
