\arguments{
\item{parameter}{list where first vector represents lambdas, the second mus and the third transition rates.}

\item{phy}{phylogenetic tree of class phylo, ultrametric, fully-resolved, rooted and with branch lengths.}

\item{traits}{vector with trait states, order of states must be the same as tree tips, for help, see vignette.}

\item{num_concealed_states}{number of concealed states, generally equivalent to number of examined states.}

\item{use_fortran}{Should the Fortran code for numerical integration be called? Default is TRUE.}

\item{methode}{Solver for the set of equations, default is "ode45".}

\item{cond}{condition on the existence of a node root: "maddison_cond","proper_cond"(default). For details, see vignette.}

\item{root_state_weight}{the method to weigh the states:"maddison_weights","proper_weights"(default) or "equal_weights". It can also be specified the root state:the vector c(1,0,0) indicates state 1 was the root state.}

\item{sampling_fraction}{vector that states the sampling proportion per trait state. It must have as many elements as trait states.}

\item{run_parallel}{should the routine to run in parallel be called?}

\item{setting_calculation}{argument used internally to speed up calculation. It should be left blank (default : setting_calculation = NULL)}

\item{setting_parallel}{argument used internally to set a parallel calculation. It should be left blank (default : setting_parallel = NULL)}

\item{see_ancestral_states}{should the ancestral states be shown? Deafault FALSE}

\item{loglik_penalty}{the size of the penalty for all parameters; default is 0 (no penalty)}

\item{is_complete_tree}{whether or not a tree with all its extinct species is provided}

\item{func}{function to be used in solving the ODE system Currently only for testing purposes.}

\item{reltol}{relative tolerance in integration}

\item{abstol}{absolute tolerance in integration}
}
\value{
The loglikelihood of the data given the parameters

\description{
Logikelihood calculation for the SecSSE model given a set of parameters and data
}
\note{
To run in parallel it is needed to load the following libraries when windows: apTreeshape, doparallel and foreach. When unix, it requires: apTreeshape, doparallel, foreach and doMC
